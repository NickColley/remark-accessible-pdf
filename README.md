# Remark Accessible PDF

Render markdown to a PDF using remark and pdfkit.

```bash
npm install NickColley/remark-accessible-pdf
```

See the [example for how to use remark-accessible-pdf](./example/index.js).

## Development status

Not stable, it needs:

- testing with screen readers
- more markdown features supported
- more test examples

## What's the difference between this and [remark-pdf](https://github.com/inokawa/remark-pdf)?

Focus on ensuring the output is accessible including good default styling.
