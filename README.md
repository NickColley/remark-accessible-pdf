# Remark Accessible PDF

Experiment to render markdown to a PDF using remark and pdfkit.

Inspired by [remark-pdf](https://github.com/inokawa/remark-pdf) but focusing on good default styling and accessible output.

Currently pretty broken and not remotely good enought to use in anything serious.

Not even tested it with assistive technologies at this point so it could be completely pointless! Come back later.
